# Shapely Website

This project is a learning website called **Shapely**, built from scratch using an open-source template as a reference.  
I recreated it entirely with **HTML** and **CSS** to practice front-end development and improve my understanding of website structure and styling.

## Project Goals
- Practice HTML and CSS layout.  
- Explore and adapt the structure of an open-source template.  
- Build a clean and modern design from scratch.  

## Technologies
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**
